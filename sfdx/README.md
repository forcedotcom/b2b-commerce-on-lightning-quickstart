# SFDX

This is a quick and easy deployment of a Lightning B2B testing environment using SFDX and shell scripts.

This repository provides configuration files and scripts that a Salesforce developer can use to setup a SFDX project in order to deploy the testing environment. The SFDX will include the metadata from the **examples** directory, converted to the SFDX format, and will have additional scripts for deployment steps supported only in the SFDX environment.

## Getting Started

### SF Setup
1. Before continuing with the steps below, see [Install SF CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm).


2. Additionally, please install the _commerce-on-lightning_ SF Plugin: https://github.com/forcedotcom/commerce-on-lightning
    - sf plugins install @salesforce/commerce
    - sf plugins install shane-sfdx-plugins


### Quick Start

1. Clone the whole b2b-commerce-for-lightning repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/forcedotcom/b2b-commerce-on-lightning-quickstart.git
```
If you cannot clone from that location, download the .zip file and unzip it locally.

Note that this repo already contains all of the files that make it a SFDX project, so no need to run a command to initialize a project.

2. Move the context of your terminal window, first into the newly cloned directory:
```
cd b2b-commerce-on-lightning-quickstart
``` 
and then into the sfdx subdirectory:
```
cd sfdx
```

From the sfdx directory, run the script:
```
./convert-examples-to-sfdx.sh
```
that will convert the examples from the metadata API format to the SFDX format and add them to the "path" you have specified in the sfdx-project.json file.

3. Create a scratch org using SFDX.
   If you don't have a dev hub already authorized, do that now by running
```
sf org login web -d
```
This will open a new browser window where you have to enter the credentials of your Dev Hub. The -d option will set that Dev Hub as your default one. Once you're logged in, the Dev Hub is authorized and you can close the browser. The Dev Hub will manage your future scratch orgs.

Make sure that your current directory is sfdx. Run the following command to create a scratch org and specify the username for the administrator in an email format:
```
sf org create scratch -f config/project-scratch-def.json --username=<YourScratchOrgUsernameInEmailFormat> -d -y <DurationInDays>
```
This command may take a while to run (minutes, but not more than 5-10 minutes) and you won't see output while it's running. A password for your user is auto-generated but it's hidden.

To open the new org:
```
sf org open
```
Note: if that fails, you might need to first set that new scratch org as your default org with
```
sf config set defaultusername=<YourScratchOrgUsernameInEmailFormat>
```

Notice that the existing settings in the ```project-scratch-def.json``` file will enable all the necessary licenses and org perms and prefs required for Lightning B2B. If the scratch org creation is successful you should not need to modify any org perms or prefs. This is only available for the scratch orgs though, and will not work for developer edition orgs, sandboxes or other environments. For those orgs, follow the [B2B Commerce on Lightning Experience Setup Guide](https://resources.docs.salesforce.com/latest/latest/en-us/sfdc/pdf/b2b_standalone_setup.pdf).

4. Make sure that your current directory is sfdx. Create and set up a new store in your new scratch org by running the following script:
```
./quickstart-create-and-setup-store.sh
```

You are done!

### Manual Steps

#### Push Samples
This is taken care of in step 4 of the Quick Start instructions above. However, if you wish to push updated samples to the new org:
```
sf project deploy start -c
```
#### Setup Store
This is also triggered by step 4 of the Quick Start instructions above. You would only need to run this step if you wanted to setup a store again. If you have a store already created (from the previous step or because you created it manually), first, make sure to adjust configuration settings such as Username and/or Email in the definition file for your Buyer User at config/buyer-user-def.json. Then run the following script to setup your store:
```
./quickstart-setup-store.sh <YourStoreName>
```
This script will:
- register the Apex classes needed for checkout integrations and map them to your store
- associate the clone of the checkout flow to the checkout component in your store
- add the Customer Community Plus Profile clone to the list of members for the store
- import Products and necessary related store data in order to get you started
- create a Buyer User and attach a Buyer Profile to it
- create a Buyer Account and add it to the relevant Buyer Group
- add Contact Point Addresses for Shipping and Billing to your new buyer Account
- activate the store
- publish your store so that the changes are reflected
- build the search index for your store
- set a password for the new Buyer User and display the user details (including user name and password)
- setup Guest Browsing by default for B2C stores

7. Your new store is almost ready to go! Before you log in as the Buyer User, you need to perform these last steps manually:

- 7.1 Setting up Credit Card Authorization

By default, a mocked gateway (SalesforceAdapter) integration has been set up.  You can quickly set up another integration with Payeezy and/or Stripe by running:
```
./quickstart-setup-payments.sh <YourStoreName>
```

For further customizations to your gateway, see the documentation [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_commercepayments_adapter_intro.htm).

- 7.2 Enable Guest Browsing

By default, Guest Browsing has been disabled for B2B stores but enabled in B2C stores. Even if Guest Browsing is currently disabled in your store, you can enable it by running
```
./enable-guest-browsing.sh <YourStoreName> <NameOfBuyerGroup>
```

If you have used Quick Start to setup your store, the name of your Buyer Group will be "BUYERGROUP_FROM_QUICKSTART_1".

## The `sfdx-project.json` File

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.

The most important parts of this file for getting started are the `sfdcLoginUrl` and `packageDirectories` properties.

The `sfdcLoginUrl` specifies the default login URL to use when authorizing an org.

The `packageDirectories` filepath tells VS Code and Salesforce CLI where the metadata files for your project are stored. You need at least one package directory set in your file. The default setting is shown below. If you set the value of the `packageDirectories` property called `path` to `force-app`, by default your metadata goes in the `force-app` directory. If you want to change that directory to something like `src`, simply change the `path` value and make sure the directory you’re pointing to exists.
```json
"packageDirectories" : [
{
"path": "force-app",
"default": true
}
]
```
## Working with Source

For details about developing against scratch orgs, see the [Package Development Model](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sfdx_dev_model) module on Trailhead or [Package Development Model with VS Code](https://forcedotcom.github.io/salesforcedx-vscode/articles/user-guide/package-development-model).

For details about developing against orgs that don’t have source tracking, see the [Org Development Model](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/org-development-model) module on Trailhead or [Org Development Model with VS Code](https://forcedotcom.github.io/salesforcedx-vscode/articles/user-guide/org-development-model).

## Deploying to Production

Don’t deploy your code to production directly from Visual Studio Code. The deploy and retrieve commands do not support transactional operations, which means that a deployment can fail in a partial state. Also, the deploy and retrieve commands don’t run the tests needed for production deployments. The push and pull commands are disabled for orgs that don’t have source tracking, including production orgs.

Deploy your changes to production using [packaging](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_dev2gp.htm) or by [converting your source](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_source.htm#cli_reference_convert) into metadata format and using the [metadata deploy command](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_mdapi.htm#cli_reference_deploy).

## More Information about what is installed

Once installed, you should be able actually take a cart through checkout as a buyer user. However, while the flow of the checkout functions, much of the important work is mocked. To see what was installed so you can determine what to update, you should go to the Examples directory and then navigate into the directories you care about. For instance, the *framework* directory contains all of the flows that control the flow of the checkout. The *integrations* directory is where you'll find Apex classes that can be updated to hook up to real systems to determine shipping and taxes.

## Enabling Promotions and Using built in Pricing

Salesforce provides engines for Pricing and Promotions. We have provided a second main flow that includes Salesforce pricing and promotions. This flow is slightly more complicated and uses more subflows, but comes with some more functionality. Some of the integrations, Pricing and Promotions, run asynchronously which can cause delays during checkout

## Installing the Re-entrant flow

The re-entrant flow is a bit more complicated than the main flow, but has some advantages like allowing customers to leave the checkout and come back later and it'll save their spot in the checkout. It also uses the built in pricing and promotions by default, but also runs asynchronously which can cause delays during checkout. It's possible to install this flow manually by following the [readme](../examples/checkout-reentrant). Alternatively, you can have it installed by default instead of the primary flow by installing it slightly differently than specified in the instructions above.

1. Before step 2 above, make sure you delete the force-app directory. This will delete everything in that directory, so make sure you either back it up or don't have any local changes in there before doing this.
```
rm -rf force-app
```
2. Instead of step 2 above, type the following:
```
./convert-examples-to-sfdx.sh -f reentrant
```
3. Continue on with installation on step 3 above normally.

## Known Issues

### Flow Debugging

Debugging with the flow typically requires impersonating a buyer [Run flow as another user](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_ls_debug_flow_as_another_user.htm&type=5&release=232). However, the custom payment component installed as a part of this installation will be run as the user that is debugging, and not the buyer. This typically causes some malfunctioning behavior like missing billing addresses. There are a few workarounds.

1. Don't debug and instead run as the buyer within the store relying on errors sent to the email specified in `Process Automation Settings` to find problems.
1. If you know the buyer's account you can make a change in [B2BPaymentController.cls](../examples/lwc/force-app/main/default/classes/B2BPaymentController.cls). Directions are specified near the top of `getPaymentInfo()`.
1. You can also make a change in the `getUserAccountInfo()` method in [B2BUtils.cls](../examples/lwc/force-app/main/default/classes/B2BUtils.cls). Here you would put the ID of the user instead of the call to `UserInfo.getUserId();`. This was not documented within the class as the effects would be farther reaching than in B2BPaymentController.cls.
